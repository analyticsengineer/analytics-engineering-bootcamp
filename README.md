This project was all about moving data from mySQl to BigQuery then transforming the data with dbt for analytics purpose. 

In this bootcamp we were taught **Bus MAtrix** for understanding **Kimball's Methodology** here is a link to my completed [Bus Matrix](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TJfo81_6C8d3j-KG3sLmTaBXvAbXIfMykLEDJOQ6n5A/edit?usp=sharing) on googlesheet for this project.

The dataset used for this project is the **Northwind dataset** it is uploaded to this repository with the ERD logical, conceptual, and physical designs.

Read my blog post for more understanding on this project.
